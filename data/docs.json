No unnecessary decoration or irrelevant content.\n\n<br><br>\n\nOur principles in action\n<hr>\n\n## For all platforms\n\n![platforms](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/images1x/principles_in-action_all-platforms@2x_4bxuVMMLNV2bH2OHPwAYkV_1568840929590.png)\n\nWe believe that people should have a high quality experience that effortlessly scales across platforms.\n\nSpectrum considers all platforms — for both desktop and mobile — from the ground up. We recognize that people work across many different products and often need to context switch, so our scale system accounts for better legibility and easier UI interactions to set a foundation for consistent experiences across devices.\n\n[Learn about platform scale](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/platform-scale/)\n\n## For everyone\n\n![for-everyone](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/images1x/principles_in-action_for-everyone@2x_4cq4MJtcYQoXpB7evUNtMZ_1568840942209.png)\n\nWe believe in building for the widest audience possible.\n\nSpectrum is designed to be clearly readable, intuitive to use, and mindful of those who require alternative input peripherals or screen readers. Everything in our system — from color and type to interaction and language — is built to be compliant with industry standards.\n\n[Learn about inclusive design](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/inclusive-design/)\n\n[Learn about international design](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/international-design/)\n\n[Learn about bi-directionality](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/bi-directionality/)\n\n## Evolving and transparent\n\n![evolving](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/images1x/principles_in-action_evolving-transparent@2x_2fUqE2qPqwgE1dJJX88HvE_1568840950943.png)\n\nWe believe in a system that’s visible, flexible, and evolves.\n\nSpectrum is built with transparency at its core. Everything in our system has its own individual versioning, a list of open issues, and a design checklist that communicate overall status. We want to consistently communicate what we’re working on, set clear expectations, and build trust with our users so that we can strengthen the relationships that help products and industries grow.\n\n[Check out what’s new](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/whats-new/)\n\n## Built by a community\n\n![community](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/images1x/principles_in-action_community@2x_AdX2rvgOGaCLcRl6Q2je5_1568840961046.png)\n\nWe believe that our system gets its strength from everyone.\n\nSpectrum connects many different talents, viewpoints, and skills into something that benefits all Adobe products. Anyone at Adobe can contribute to a collection of design elements that are being considered as additions to the design system.",
